## Purpose of the Project
This project aims to develop a user-friendly web application that allows users to calculate earnings from a mutual fund. Our goal is to provide a fun interactive way to visualize the growth of funds, and also to educate users on the importance of investing early.

## Tools Utilized
- **Programming Languages:** Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
- **Frameworks:** React, Springboot 
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Hosting:** Github Pages 

## Problems Encountered and Solutions
1. **Sending Data:**
   - **Problem:** Initial difficulty sending data/ utilzing methods from the backend to the frontend/backend to the frontend.
   - **Solution:** The team used a file to save data and format it as a JSON for frontend to read.

2. **Database Performance:**
   - **Problem:** Slow query performance in MongoDB during peak usage.
   - **Solution:** Implemented indexing for frequently queried fields and optimized the database schema, significantly improving performance.

3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**
   - **Problem:** Inconsistent styling and functionality across different browsers.
   - **Solution:** Utilized cross-browser testing tools and applied appropriate CSS resets and polyfills to ensure consistent behavior.
