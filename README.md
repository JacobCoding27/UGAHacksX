## Purpose of the Project
This project aims to develop a user-friendly web application that allows users to calculate earnings from a mutual fund. Our goal is to provide a fun interactive way to visualize the growth of funds, and also to educate users on the importance of investing early.

## Tools Utilized
- **Programming Languages:** Java, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks:** React, Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Hosting:** Heroku

## Problems Encountered and Solutions
1. **Integration Issues:**
   - **Problem:** Initial difficulty integrating the React frontend with the Node.js backend.
   - **Solution:** The team conducted a series of focused study sessions on API integration and utilized comprehensive documentation from both frameworks to understand the process thoroughly.

2. **Database Performance:**
   - **Problem:** Slow query performance in MongoDB during peak usage.
   - **Solution:** Implemented indexing for frequently queried fields and optimized the database schema, significantly improving performance.

3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**
   - **Problem:** Inconsistent styling and functionality across different browsers.
   - **Solution:** Utilized cross-browser testing tools and applied appropriate CSS resets and polyfills to ensure consistent behavior.
